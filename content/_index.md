title = "PDE-AI Workshop"
+++

Traditional PDE modeling, control, and optimization methods—rooted in analytical models and numerical solvers—have long provided rigorous guarantees but often face challenges of strong modeling assumptions, scalability, and data integration. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming this landscape. Data-driven approaches are now able to identify governing PDEs directly from data, construct physics-informed reduced-order models, and design controllers and observers with tractable computation while preserving closed-loop guarantees. Together, they are transforming control of complex, physics-based systems.

**This workshop will present the latest advances in AI for modeling, control, and optimization of PDEs, as well as PDEs arising in nonlinear control problems.** The program features a series of invited talks by invited speakers from both academia and national laboratories spanning control theory, machine learning, and different application domains. 
Together, these talks will cover new algorithmic frameworks, theoretical developments, and application-driven studies—ranging from soft robotics and fluid mechanics to charged-particle beam control and delayed dynamical systems.
