During the period from 2012 to 2016 he was a project research scientist at the Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He was an Assistant Professor at the Kevin T. Crofton Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering at Virginia Tech until 2018. He currently serves as the Dutton-Ducoffe Endowed Professor at The Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech. He holds a secondary appointment in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His expertise is in reinforcement learning, control theory, game theory, cyber-physical security, bounded rationality, and safe/assured autonomy. He has received numerous prestigious awards, including the 2019 ARO YIP Award, the 2018 NSF CAREER Award, the 2018 DoD Minerva Research Initiative Award, and the 2021 GT Chapter Sigma Xi Young Faculty Award. His work has also been recognized with several best paper nominations and international awards, such as the 2016 International Neural Network Society Young Investigator (INNS) Award.  He is the Editor-in-Chief of Aerospace Science and Technology and currently serves on the IEEE Control Systems Society Conference Editorial Board. Additionally, he is an Associate Editor for several journals, including Automatica, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, etc. He is a registered Professional Engineer (PE) in Electrical/Computer Engineering, a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece, and an Associate Fellow of AIAA.
