### Abstract

To be announced. 

### Biography

**Thomas Beckers** is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. Before joining Vanderbilt, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the GRASP Lab, PRECISE Center and ASSET Center. In 2020, he earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. He received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2010 and 2013, respectively, from the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany. In 2018, he was a visiting researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a DAAD AInet fellow and was awarded with the Rhode \& Schwarz Outstanding Dissertation Prize. His research interests include physics-enhanced learning, nonparametric models, and safe learning-based control. He organized several workshops on the intersection between machine learning and control, including topics such as physics-informed learning and Gaussian-process based control.
