To be announced. 

### Biography

**Steven L. Brunton** is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.  He is also Adjunct Professor of Applied Mathematics and Computer science, and a Data Science Fellow at the eScience Institute.  Steve received the B.S. in mathematics from Caltech in 2006 and the Ph.D. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton in 2012.  His research combines machine learning with dynamical systems to model and control systems in fluid dynamics, biolocomotion, optics, energy systems, and manufacturing.  He received the Army and Air Force Young Investigator Program (YIP) awards and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). Steve is also passionate about teaching math to engineers as co-author of three textbooks and through his popular YouTube channel, under the moniker “eigensteve”.
