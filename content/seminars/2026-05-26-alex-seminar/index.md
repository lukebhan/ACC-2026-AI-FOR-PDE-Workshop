### Abstract

To be announced. 

### Biography

**Alexander Scheinker** is a Staff Researcher with Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he is the Adaptive Machine Learning Team Leader in the Applied Electrodynamics group. His research focuses on applying advanced control theory and machine learning methods to electrodynamics and for the stabilization and optimization of noisy and analytically unknown complex time-varying systems. Alexander received undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics from Washington University in St. Louis, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in control theory from the University of California, San Diego, in 2008 and 2012, respectively. He has been developing extremum-seeking (ES) algorithms, proving their stability properties, and applying them for noninvasive diagnostics and for the control of intensely charged particle beams in large particle accelerator facilities. His recent research focuses on combining ES with deep learning methods such as 3-D convolutional neural networks, to develop AI tools that are robust for time-varying systems with distribution shift. He has coauthored more than 20 journal papers on ES theory and applications and the book titled Model-Free Stabilization by Extremum Seeking.
